# Deloitte Hackathon 2017 - Fraud Analysis Challenge

This is the project code for a hackathon challenge hosted by [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/de.html). The aim was to find suspicious (possibly fraudulent) activity in an anonymised customer database and trace it back to likely culprits. As it is a result of a very short hackathon, this code is not documented and there is no guidance to running it.
